# Coronavirus Statistics Tracker Discord Bot
## Description
I give real-time updates on news and statistics regarding Covid-19 in various countries! A personal side-project to help familiarize myself with Python and APIs.
> Technologies Used
Python, Discord.py, Open Disease API
## Getting Started
![Help Command](images/help_command.png)

' !h '

The help command simply lists all the available commands the Discord Bot has:
1. !inspire - returns a random inspiration quote (taken from ZenQuotes API)
2. !cases - returns up to date coronavirus statistics regarding the world
3. !cases <country_name> - returns up-to-date coronavirus statistics for specified country in parameter

## Credits
I took inspiration from the Discord Bot tutorial from Code Academy and expanded on my project creating new methods to pull data from open-source APIs for specifically Covid-19 related statistics.
